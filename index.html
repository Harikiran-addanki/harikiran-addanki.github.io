Where I've worked

HARDWARE CREATOR ONBOARDING & LIFECYCLE
	•	Onboarded 100+ independent hardware creators as vendors into Mouser's ecosystem — managing the full pipeline from campaign funding through manufacturing, inbound shipment, and platform listing. Coordinated NPI documentation, technical specifications, and inventory replenishment via POs — primary operational interface between creators and Mouser's global distribution network. Optimized MOQ and lead-time workflows, reducing customer complaint response times to under 24 hours.
PRODUCT LAUNCH & PLATFORM OPERATIONS
	•	Delivered 200+ product listings on Mouser.com — owning specification intake, data structuring, and platform readiness from post-manufacturing through live publication. Maintained 100% data accuracy across vendor and product databases (GitHub, Zaphod) supporting reliable operations across a months-long creator-to-distribution cycle.
PROCESS INITIATIVES & CROSS-FUNCTIONAL EXPANSION
	•	Initiated a post-launch creator communication workflow — proactively notifying creators when products go live on Mouser, guiding inventory management, and monitoring stock levels to trigger replenishment before depletion. Process approved by management and now standard practice. Raising Product Content Requests to Mouser's internal product team for microsite creation — extending creator visibility on the platform and bridging operational onboarding with web presence.
COMPLIANCE & TRADE
	•	Independently facilitated RoHS compliance and OFAC screening for all creator products entering international distribution — ensuring regulatory readiness across global markets. Direct operational liaison to the President of Crowd Supply, supporting cross-functional strategy, creator relationships, and platform initiatives across US and India. 🏆 Rising Star Award (Q1 2024)  ·  Best Performer Award (Q1 2025)
